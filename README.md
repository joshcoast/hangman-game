# JavaScript Exercise

### Overview

In this assignment, I've created a Hangman game. This apps will run in the browser, and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by the JavaScript code.


1. Use key events to listen for the letters that your players will type.

2. Display the following on the page:

3. Press any key to get started!

4. Wins: (# of times user guessed the word correctly).

   * If the word is `madonna`, display it like this when the game starts: `_ _ _ _ _ _ _`.

   * As the user guesses the correct letters, reveal them: `m a d o _  _ a`.

5. Number of Guesses Remaining: (# of guesses remaining for the user).

6. Letters Already Guessed: (Letters the user has guessed, displayed like `L Z Y H`).

7. After the user wins/loses the game should automatically choose another word and make the user play it.

##### Hangman Game Bonuses

1. Play a sound or song when the user guesses their word correctly, like in our demo.
2. Write some stylish CSS rules to make a design that fits your game's theme.
3. **HARD MODE:** Organize your game code as an object, except for the key events to get the letter guessed. This will be a challenge if you haven't coded with JavaScript before, but we encourage anyone already familiar with the language to try this out.
4. Save your whole game and its properties in an object.
5. Save any of your game's functions as methods, and call them underneath your object declaration using event listeners.
6. Don't forget to place your global variables and functions above your object.
   * Remember: global variables, then objects, then calls.
